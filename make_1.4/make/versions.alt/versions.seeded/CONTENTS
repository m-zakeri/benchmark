v1 corresponds to make-3.76.1, however, note that for versions.seeded, 
    this really corresponds to v0-v1, as the faults inserted are seeded 
    into v1 and represent faults acquired from v0 to v1
v2 corresponds to make-3.77, or v1-v2
v3 corresponds to make-3.78.1, or v2-v3
v4 corresponds to make-3.79, or v3-v4
