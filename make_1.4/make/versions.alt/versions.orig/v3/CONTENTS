v3 - Make-3.78.1

Contains the *.h files and a .c file that will compile and link into an
executable 3.78 version of Make

To create an executable named make.exe, use the following command

make build

To create make.st.int.exe make.bt.int.exe, use the following command 

make build-st
or
make build-bt

All original .c files were either merged into make.c or deleted if they
were unnecessary.  All .h files were saved except for the win32 ones.
Everything else was deleted.
